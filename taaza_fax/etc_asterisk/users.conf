; User configuration
;
; Creating entries in users.conf is a "shorthand" for creating individual
; entries in each configuration file.  Using users.conf is not intended to 
; provide you with as much flexibility as using the separate configuration
; files (e.g. sip.conf, iax.conf, etc) but is intended to accelerate the
; simple task of adding users.  Note that creating individual items (e.g.
; custom SIP peers, IAX friends, etc.) will allow you to override specific 
; parameters within this file.  Parameter names here are the same as they
; appear in the other configuration files.  There is no way to change the
; value of a parameter here for just one subsystem.
