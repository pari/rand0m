; Asterisk Builtin mini-HTTP server
;
;
; Note about Asterisk documentation:
;   If Asterisk was installed from a tarball, then the HTML documentation should
;   be installed in the static-http/docs directory which is
;   (/var/lib/asterisk/static-http/docs) on linux by default.  If the Asterisk
;   HTTP server is enabled in this file by setting the "enabled", "bindaddr",
;   and "bindport" options, then you should be able to view the documentation
;   remotely by browsing to:
;       http://<server_ip>:<bindport>/static/docs/index.html
;
[general]
;
; Whether HTTP/HTTPS interface is enabled or not.  Default is no.
; This also affects manager/rawman/mxml access (see manager.conf)
;
enabled = yes
;
; Address to bind to, both for HTTP and HTTPS.  Default is 0.0.0.0
;
bindaddr = 127.0.0.1
;
; Port to bind to for HTTP sessions (default is 8088)
;
;bindport=8088
;
; Prefix allows you to specify a prefix for all requests
; to the server.  The default is blank.  If uncommented
; all requests must begin with /asterisk
;
;prefix=asterisk
;
; Whether Asterisk should serve static content from http-static
; Default is no.
;
enablestatic = yes
;
; Redirect one URI to another.  This is how you would set a
; default page.  
;   Syntax: redirect=<from here> <to there>
; For example, if you are using the Asterisk-gui,
; it is convenient to enable the following redirect:
;
redirect = / /static/config/cfgbasic.html
